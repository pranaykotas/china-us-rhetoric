Lai since taking office refused to acknowledge 1992 Consensus, stubbornly adheres to Taiwan independence position, peddles separatist fallacies, manipulates anti-China narratives, escalates green terror, fawns over external forces attempting to rely on external support and military means for independence. Plots cross-strait economic decoupling and industrial chain-breaking, smashing people's livelihoods, offers TSMC to show loyalty to external forces, sells out Taiwan's advantageous industries and development prospects.
